Comparators are used to compare two objects. In this challenge, you'll create a comparator and use it to sort an array.
The Player class is provided for you in your editor. It has  fields: a  String and a  integer.
Given an array of  Player objects, write a comparator that sorts them in order of decreasing score; if  or more players have the same score, sort those players alphabetically by name. To do this, you must create a Checker class that implements the Comparator interface, then write an int compare(Player a, Player b) method implementing the
Comparator.compare(T o1, T o2) method.



class Checker implements Comparator<Player> {
    @Override
    public int compare(Player p1, Player p2) {
        if (p2.score == p1.score) {
            return p1.name.compareTo(p2.name);
        } else {
            return p1.score > p2.score ? -1 : 1;    
        }
    }
}
