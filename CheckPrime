You are given a class Solution and its main method in the editor. Your task is to create a class Prime. The class Prime should contain a single method checkPrime.

The locked code in the editor will call the checkPrime method with one or more integer arguments. You should write the checkPrime method in such a way that the code prints only the prime numbers.

Please read the code given in the editor carefully. Also please do not use method overloading!

import static java.lang.System.in;
class Prime {
    
    void checkPrime(int... numbers) {        
        
        for (int number : numbers) {            
            if (BigInteger.valueOf(number).isProbablePrime(1)) {
                System.out.print(number + " ");
            }
        }
        
        System.out.println();
    }  
}
