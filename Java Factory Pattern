According to Wikipedia, a factory is simply an object that returns another object from some other method call, which is assumed to be "new".

In this problem, you are given an interface Food. There are two classes Pizza and Cake which implement the Food interface, and they both contain a method getType().

The main function in the Main class creates an instance of the FoodFactory class. The FoodFactory class contains a method getFood(String) that returns a new instance of Pizza or Cake according to its parameter.

You are given the partially completed code in the editor. Please complete the FoodFactory class.


	if("Pizza".equalsIgnoreCase(order))
			return new Pizza();
		else if("Cake".equalsIgnoreCase(order))
			return new Cake();
		
		return null;
    
    
    	public static Computer getComputer(String type,String ram,String hdd,String cpu){
		if("PC".equalsIgnoreCase(type))
			return new Pc(ram,hdd,cpu);
		else if("SERVER".equalsIgnoreCase(type))
			return new Server(ram,hdd,cpu);
		
		return null;
	}
