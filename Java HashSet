In computer science, a set is an abstract data type that can store certain values, without any particular order, and no repeated values(Wikipedia).  is an example of a set, but  is not a set. Today you will learn how to use sets in java by solving this problem.

You are given  pairs of strings. Two pairs  and  are identical if  and . That also implies is not same as . After taking each pair as input, you need to print number of unique pairs you currently have.

Complete the code in the editor to solve this problem.


 HashSet<String> pairs = new HashSet<String>(t);

    for(int i = 0; i < t; i++)
    {
        pairs.add("(" + pair_left[i] + ", " + pair_right[i] + ")" );
        System.out.println(pairs.size());        
    }
